# BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-AppKinetics

`BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-AppKinetics` provides ability to use [Dynamics application-based services](https://marketplace.blackberry.com/services) within Dynamics React Native application to securely communicate with other Dynamics applications which is called Inter-Container Communication (ICC). Also, it provides service discovery, service consumption and service providing abilities for Dynamics React Native application.

#### Service providing
> Dynamics React Native application can also act as service provider of some Dynamics application-based service and receive some messages from other Dynamics application.

###### _readyToProvideService_(`serviceId`: string, `version`: string) : Promise<`string`>
`readyToProvideService` API allows to be service provider for some Dynamics application-based and respond to a consumer application from which an AppKinetics service request has been received. The response from service provider to consumer application will include a results object (see `ServiceMessage` interface below). `ServiceMessage` will notify the consumer of the success or failure of the request (see `onReceivedFile` , `onReceivedMessage` and  `onError` events handling below).
It returns a promise that resolves to a message string "**_Providing service `<serviceId>` with version `<version>`_**" in case of success and rejects to error message otherwise.

**Parameters**
| Parameter | Type | Required? | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **serviceId** | `string` | yes | identifier of the required service |
| **version** | `string` | yes | version of the required service |

**`onReceivedFile` event**
Dynamics React Native application should be subscribed on `onReceivedFile` event in order to be able to receive file sent using [Transfer File Service](https://marketplace.blackberry.com/services/273065). When file is received, event handler will be called with string representing file path passed to it. 

**`onReceivedMessage` event**
Dynamics React Native application should be subscribed on `onReceivedMessage` event in order to be able to receive message sent by consumer application via some Dynamics application-based service (other than "Transfer File Service"). When message is received, event handler will be called with following object passed to it:
```typescript
type ServiceMessage = {
    applicationId: <String>; // BlackBerry Dynamics entitlement identifier of the consumer application
    serviceId: <String>; // Service ID of the Dynamics application-based service that was used during request
    serviceVersion: <String>; // Service version of the Dynamics application-based service that was used during request
    serviceMethod: <String>; // Service method of the Dynamics application-based service that was used during request
    attachments: <String[]>; // array of strings representing paths to files within secure container
    parameters: <Object>; // object representing parameters that were send during request
};
```

**`onError` event**
Dynamics React Native application should be subscribed on `onError` event in order to be able to handle error message when error is occurred.

**Example of usage**
```typescript
import BbdAppKinetics from 'BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-AppKinetics';
import { NativeEventEmitter, NativeModules } from 'react-native';

async function testAppKinetics() {
    try {
      const result = await BbdAppKinetics.readyToProvideService('com.good.gdservice.transfer-file', '1.0.0.0');
      console.log('readyToProvideService success result:', result);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('readyToProvideService error result:', error);
    }
}

const eventEmitter = new NativeEventEmitter(NativeModules.ReactNativeBbdAppKinetics);

// subscribe on onReceivedFile
// event is fired when you receive file sent by 'com.good.gdservice.transfer-file' service
eventEmitter.addListener('onReceivedFile', (file) => {
  console.log(file); // path to file within secure container
});
 
// subscribe on onReceivedMessage
// event is fired when you receive ServiceMessage object sent by any Dynamics application-based service other than 'com.good.gdservice.transfer-file' service
eventEmitter.addListener('onReceivedMessage', (message) => {
  console.log(message);
});

// subscribe on onError
// event is fired when you receive an error
eventEmitter.addListener('onError', (message) => {
  console.log(message);
});
 
testAppKinetics();
```

#### Secure storage helper

###### _copyFilesToSecureStorage_() : Promise<{copiedInThisCall: `Array<string>`, securedDataDirEntries: `Array<string>`}>
`copyFilesToSecureStorage` API recursively copies files and directories from public `data` folder that is located in application bundle to `/data` in secure container:
 - On Android it copies from `<app>/android/app/src/main/assets/data` folder
 - On iOS it copies from linked `<app>/ios/<app_name>/data` folder: open the app in Xcode and drag-n-drop **`data`** folder (from _`<app>/ios/<app_name>/data`_) to **`<app_name>`** group so it is recognized as part of the project.

`copyFilesToSecureStorage` returns object with following structure:
```typescript
{
    copiedInThisCall: Array<string>; // array of strings representing paths to files in secure container for "/data" directory that were copied during last call
    securedDataDirEntries: Array<string>; // array of strings representing paths to files in secure container for "/data" directory
}
```

**Example of usage**
```typescript
import BbdAppKinetics from 'BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-AppKinetics';

async function testAppKinetics() {
    try {
      const result = await BbdAppKinetics.copyFilesToSecureStorage();
      console.log('copyFilesToSecureStorage success result:', result);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('copyFilesToSecureStorage error result:', error);
    }
}

testAppKinetics();
```

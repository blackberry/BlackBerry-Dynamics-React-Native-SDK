## Policy sample application
> Policy sample application shows example of usage API, which provides access to information that is globally available to any BlackBerry Dynamics Application. It demonstrates how to retrieve a collection of application configuration and application-specific policy settings. Retrieval of policy settings is happening during method call, or whenever settings are changed (event-based approach).

#### How to prepare the app
Open the sample app directory in Terminal window:
`$ cd <path>/SampleApplications/Policy`

Install dependencies:
`$ yarn`

> NOTE: Policy sample is based on `0.66.4` version of React Native. There is a possibility to upgrade to `0.67.x` or `0.68.x` versions (`0.67.0` - `0.67.4`, `0.68.0` - `0.68.2`) by running one of following commands:
`$ react-native upgrade 0.6x.x`
for example:
`$ react-native upgrade 0.67.4`
or
`$ react-native upgrade 0.68.2`

Generate ios and android directories:
`$ react-native eject`

## Dynamics modules
#### Prerequisites
There are some dependencies that need to be installed before using `BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Base` module. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/blackberry/BlackBerry-Dynamics-React-Native-SDK/tree/master/modules/BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Base#Preconditions).

#### How to integrate Dynamics into application
	$ yarn add <path>/modules/BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Base

> Integrates Dynamics based on your current identifiers - iOS Bundle ID and Android Package Name.

	$ yarn set-bundle-id (Optional step, but required for sample applications)

> Allows to update an identifier (required) and name (optional) for your application. This identifier is your iOS Bundle ID or Android Package Name. It will also be used as the Entitlement ID for entitling and activating your application with the BlackBerry UEM management console.

#### How to add Application module
	$ yarn add <path>/modules/BlackBerry-Dynamics-for-React-Native-Application

##### iOS
`$ cd ios`  
`$ pod install`  
`$ cd ..`
